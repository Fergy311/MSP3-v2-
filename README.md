  # Deployment

## GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using these steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Fergy311/course-reposi)
2. Locate the Navbar at the top of the Repository (not top of page). Click the Settings tab.
3. Locate the Navbar on the left hand side of the page. Click the "Pages" section (under 'Code and automation').
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "main". Click save.
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. A notification will appear at the top of the page with the [link](https://fergy311.github.io/course-reposi/) to the deployed site. You can return to this GitHub Pages section to access the link.

## Forking the GitHub Repository

Forks are used to propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. By forking the GitHub Repository you make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository.

To Fork a Github Repository:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Isabella-Mitchell/milestone-project-one)
2. Locate the Fork button in the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

You will now have a fork of the repository, but you don't have the files in that repository locally on your computer.

To make a local clone:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Isabella-Mitchell/milestone-project-one)
2. Above the list of files, click  Code.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click the 'Copy' icon. To clone the repository using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click Use SSH, then click the 'Copy' icon. To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click Use GitHub CLI, then click the 'Copy' icon.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub AE username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
